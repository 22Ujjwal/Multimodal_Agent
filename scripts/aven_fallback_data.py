Learn everything you need to know about HELOCs, credit, and personal finance.

## HELOC Basics

### What is a HELOC?
A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) allows you to borrow against the equity in your home. Unlike a traditional loan, a HELOC works like a credit card - you can borrow what you need, when you need it.

### How HELOCs Work
- **Credit Limit**: Based on your home's value and existing mortgage
- **Draw Period**: Usually 10 years to access funds
- **Repayment Period**: Typically 20 years to pay back
- **Interest Rates**: Variable rates tied to prime rate

### Benefits of HELOCs
- Lower interest rates than credit cards
- Tax-deductible interest (consult tax advisor)
- Flexible access to funds
- Only pay interest on what you use

## Credit Management

### Building Good Credit
- Pay bills on time
- Keep credit utilization low
- Monitor your credit report
- Don't close old accounts

### Understanding Credit Scores
- Payment history (35%)
- Credit utilization (30%)
- Length of credit history (15%)
- Credit mix (10%)
- New credit (10%)

## Financial Planning Tips

1. Create a budget and stick to it
2. Build an emergency fund
3. Pay down high-interest debt first
4. Save for retirement early
